# City Schools Analysis

The following includes an analysis of district-wide standardized test results. Resources files include every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The data was aggregated to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The final report includes each of the following:

### District Summary

  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### School Summary

* An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
  
### Math Scores by Grade

* A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). The table includes each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Size

* A table that breaks down school performances based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large). The table includes each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Type

* A table that breaks down school performances based on school type (Charter vs. District). The table includes each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)


### Observale trends noted from data analysis:

* More spending per studnet does not mean  higher studnet outcomes for math and reading scores 
* Students in larger schools earn, overall, lower grades across both math and reading
* Student enrolled in charter schools earn higher grades in both math and reading
